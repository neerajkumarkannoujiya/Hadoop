Install Gredle in Ubuntu

Step 1: Update Your System
First, ensure your system is up to date:
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade

Step 2: Verify Java Installation
Make sure Java 8 is installed and set as the default Java version:
java -version
You should see something like:
openjdk version "1.8.0_xxx"

If Java 8 is not installed, you can install it using:
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk

Step 3: Download Gradle
Visit the Gradle releases page to find the latest stable version.
Copy the download link for the binary-only distribution.
For example, to download Gradle 8.5 (replace the version with the latest one):
wget https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.5-bin.zip

Step 4: Install Gradle
Extract the downloaded file:
sudo unzip gradle-8.5-bin.zip -d /opt/gradle
Create a symbolic link to make it easier to use:
sudo ln -s /opt/gradle/gradle-8.5 /opt/gradle/latest

Step 5: Set Up Environment Variables
Open your .bashrc or .zshrc file for editing:
nano ~/.bashrc
Add the following lines at the end of the file:
export GRADLE_HOME=/opt/gradle/latest
export PATH=${GRADLE_HOME}/bin:${PATH}
Save and exit the editor, then reload the shell configuration:
source ~/.bashrc

Step 6: Verify Gradle Installation
Check if Gradle is installed correctly:
gradle -v
You should see output similar to:
------------------------------------------------------------
Gradle 8.5
------------------------------------------------------------
...

Step 7: Create a Gradle Project
To create a new Gradle project, navigate to your desired directory and run:
gradle init
